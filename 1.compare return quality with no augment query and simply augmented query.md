In last section, we just put a RAG process by assembly all components together. We can gain first hand experience for RAG process but we don't know the logic behide it, that is why and how each component come into its place, why we need that
component and why we need to assembly then in the given way. In this section, we will begin from a raw project, and check what kind of problems or diffculties we will have and see why we need the given component to save life, but doing this,
we will know the logic behide the whole RAG process.

We still using the notebook from previous section, ensure the given packages and api key configurations. In last section, we using a prompt component from langchain to help us create a prompt, this time we first try to do it by our own.
Let's add the following code to generate prompt by ourself:

```py
from openai import OpenAI
import time
client = OpenAI()
gptmodel = "gpt-4o"

def generate_answer(prompt):
  print(f"generate answer prompt: {prompt}")
  try:
    start = time.time()
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model = gptmodel,
        messages = [
            {'role':"system", "content": "You are an expert of llm and RAG"},
            {'role':"assistant", "content": "You can explain read the input and answer in detail"},
            {'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}
        ],
        temperature = 0.1, #let the model has some kind of freedom to imaginate
    )
    #this is the job of StrOutputParser
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
  except Exception as e:
    return str(e)

def call_llm_with_self_prompot(questions):
  #text_input = '\n'.join(questions)
  #we do this by langchain hub
  prompt = f"Please elaborate on the following content:\n {questions}"
  print(f"prompt is : {prompt}")
  return generate_answer(prompt)

import textwrap
#this is the job of StrOutputParser
def print_formatted_response(response):
  wrapper = textwrap.TextWrapper(width = 80) #80 words in a line
  wrapped_text = wrapper.fill(text=response)
  print("Response:")
  print("----------------")
  print(wrapped_text)
  print("----------------")
```
Run the code aboved and we can call the aboved call as following:
```py
query = "tell me something about rag store"
llm_response = call_llm_with_self_prompot(query)
response = print_formatted_response(llm_response)
print(response)
```
Then we get the following answer:
```py
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a sophisticated hybrid approach
in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly within the realm of
natural language processing (NLP). It innovatively combines the capabilities of
neural network-based language models with retrieval systems to enhance the
generation of text, making it more accurate, informative, and contextually
relevant. This methodology leverages the strengths of both generative and
retrieval architectures to tackle complex tasks that require not only linguistic
fluency but also factual correctness and depth of knowledge. At the core of
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a generative model, typically a
transformer-based neural network, similar to those used in models like GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers). This component is responsible for producing
coherent and contextually appropriate language outputs based on a mixture of
input prompts and additional information fetched by the retrieval component.
Complementing the language model is the retrieval system, which is usually built
on a database of documents or a corpus of texts. This system uses techniques
from information retrieval to find and fetch documents that are relevant to the
input query or prompt. The mechanism of relevance determination can range from
simple keyword matching to more complex semantic search algorithms which
interpret the meaning behind the query to find the best matches. This component
merges the outputs from the language model and the retrieval system. It
effectively synthesizes the raw data fetched by the retrieval system into the
generative process of the language model. The integrator ensures that the
information from the retrieval system is seamlessly incorporated into the final
text output, enhancing the model's ability to generate responses that are not
only fluent and grammatically correct but also rich in factual details and
context-specific nuances. When a query or prompt is received, the system first
processes it to understand the requirement or the context. Based on the
processed query, the retrieval system searches through its database to find
relevant documents or information snippets. This retrieval is guided by the
similarity of content in the documents to the query, which can be determined
through various techniques like vector embeddings or semantic similarity
measures. The retrieved documents are then fed into the language model. In some
implementations, this integration happens at the token level, where the model
can access and incorporate specific pieces of information from the retrieved
texts dynamically as it generates each part of the response. The language model,
now augmented with direct access to retrieved information, generates a response.
This response is not only influenced by the training of the model but also by
the specific facts and details contained in the retrieved documents, making it
more tailored and accurate. By directly incorporating information from external
sources, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models can produce responses that
are more factual and relevant to the given query. This is particularly useful in
domains like medical advice, technical support, and other areas where precision
and up-to-date knowledge are crucial. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems can dynamically adapt to new information since they retrieve data in
real-time from their databases. This allows them to remain current with the
latest knowledge and trends without needing frequent retraining. With access to
a wide range of documents, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
provide detailed and nuanced answers that a standalone language model might not
be capable of generating based solely on its pre-trained knowledge. While
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers substantial benefits, it also comes
with its challenges. These include the complexity of integrating retrieval and
generation systems, the computational overhead associated with real-time data
retrieval, and the need for maintaining a large, up-to-date, and high-quality
database of retrievable texts. Furthermore, ensuring the relevance and accuracy
of the retrieved information remains a significant challenge, as does managing
the potential for introducing biases or errors from the external sources. In
summary, Retrieval Augmented Generation represents a significant advancement in
the field of artificial intelligence, merging the best of retrieval-based and
generative technologies to create systems that not only understand and generate
natural language but also deeply comprehend and utilize the vast amounts of
information available in textual form. A RAG vector store is a database or
dataset that contains vectorized data points. 
```
As we can see the output is a huge chunk of text but content of text is not what we need, it tells lots of info but the relevant info with our query seems to be nothing. That is the point we need to enhance for next step.
what we need to do is provide context for the query, the context will guaid the llm to generate response in given direction instead of letting llm try very possible direction and generate response with low quality. The point is 
how we can provide the context for given query?

As we have seen in previous section, the context may need to crawl from web page, load from database, extract from pdf documents, data preparation or domain knowlege construction is a very complex and engineering demanding, we will spend
a whole chapter at this regard, but now let's assume we already have domain knowlege ready, for example we have following content regarding to RAG info:
```py
#webbaseloader => 信息抓取 => 问题背景或者特定知识库
#假设数据已经准备好了
#here should be handle by WebBaseLoader or PDFLoader
#查看问题和段落拥有共同词汇的数量, bank, river bank, central bank
query = 'tell me something about rag store'

As you can see there are many paragraphs in the text, given query "tell me something about rag store", how can we find one or many pargraphs that can be the context of the query. There are many ways to do this, the most simple way is, we
check how many common word between the query and given paragraph, the more common words, the more relevant they are. But this approch is problematic, for example "river bank" and "central bank" , this two text sharer one common word "bank",
but the "bank" has totally different meaning in this two sentence, the later is more relevant with "finacial institution" even though the latter share no common word with "central bank", but at now let's try this approch:

```py
query = "tell me something about rag store"
#how we can extract piece of data from document as right context
#job for retriever
#a simple method that is check relevant of two texts => compare how many common words they share,
#(query, text1), => common word 3, (query,text2) => commond word 4, text2 is more relevant thant text1
#river bank, central bank

def similarity_by_matching_common_words(text1, text2):
  '''
  split the two input texts into words, then compute the number of common words
  '''
  text1_words = set(text1.lower().split())
  text2_words = set(text2.lower().split())
  common_words = text1_words.intersection(text2_words)
  return len(common_words)


def find_best_match_piece(query, db_records):
  best_score = 0
  best_record = 0
  for record in db_records:
    current_score = similarity_by_matching_common_words(query, record)
    if current_score > best_score:
      best_score = current_score
      best_record = record

  return best_score, best_record


best_score, best_record = find_best_match_piece(query, db_records)

print(f"best score:{best_score}, best record: {best_record}")
```
We use above code to check the number of common words between the query and each paragraph in the db_records array, running above code we get the following result:

```py
best score:2, best record: A RAG vector store is a database or dataset that contains vectorized data points.
```
Then we can create an augmented query as following:
```py
augmented_input = query + ":" + best_record
print_formatted_response(augmented_input)
```
Running above code we get the following return:
```py
Response:
---------------
tell me something about rag store:A RAG vector store is a database or dataset
that contains vectorized data points.
--------------
```
Then we can use the augmented query to ask llm generate return:
```py
llm_response = call_llm_with_self_prompt(augmented_input)
print_formatted_response(llm_response)
```
The given reurn for above code is :
```py

llm_response = call_llm_with_self_prompt(augmented_input)
print_formatted_response(llm_response)
generate answer from prompt:tell me something about rag store:A RAG vector store is a database or dataset that contains vectorized data points.
Response:
---------------
A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) vector store is a specialized database
designed to store and manage vectorized data points. These data points are
typically high-dimensional vectors that represent various forms of information,
such as text, images, or other types of data that have been transformed into a
numerical format suitable for machine learning and retrieval tasks.  Here are
some key aspects of a RAG vector store:  1. **Vector Representation**: In a RAG
vector store, data is stored in the form of vectors. These vectors are often
generated using techniques such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe),
sentence embeddings (e.g., BERT, Sentence-BERT), or other forms of feature
extraction that convert raw data into a numerical format.  2. **Efficient
Retrieval**: One of the primary purposes of a RAG vector store is to enable
efficient retrieval of relevant data points based on similarity measures. This
is typically achieved using techniques such as nearest neighbor search, which
allows for quick identification of vectors that are similar to a given query
vector.  3. **Augmented Generation**: In the context of RAG, the vector store is
used to augment the generation process. For example, in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, a RAG model might retrieve relevant documents or
passages from the vector store to provide context or additional information that
can be used to generate more accurate and informative responses.  4.
**Scalability**: RAG vector stores are designed to handle large volumes of data
and support scalable retrieval operations. This often involves the use of
specialized data structures and indexing techniques, such as KD-trees, ball
trees, or approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms like HNSW (Hierarchical
Navigable Small World) graphs.  5. **Integration with Machine Learning Models**:
RAG vector stores are typically integrated with machine learning models that
perform the retrieval and generation tasks. For example, a RAG model might use a
transformer-based architecture for text generation, while relying on the vector
store to retrieve relevant context or knowledge.  6. **Applications**: RAG
vector stores have a wide range of applications, including question answering
systems, chatbots, recommendation systems, and any other scenario where it is
beneficial to retrieve and utilize relevant information to enhance the
generation process.  In summary, a RAG vector store is a crucial component in
systems that combine retrieval and generation tasks, enabling efficient and
scalable access to vectorized data points to support various machine learning
and information retrieval applications.

As we can see, the quality of return is improved substantially.
